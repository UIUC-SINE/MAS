We repeat this experiment for $S = 2, 3, 4$ uniformly spaced spectral components under a variety of noise levels and spectral component separations.  In Figure XXX, we plot the mean SSIM of the reconstructions obtained from measurements at focal planes (blue) and measurements at planes selected by SBS (orange).  The SBS reconstructions generally outperform the focal plane reconstructions except when the spectral component separation is large enough (around XXX nm).  With sufficient separation, we have found that SBS converges to a final measurement configuration near the focal planes.
