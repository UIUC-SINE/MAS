* 2018-05-05 - CSBS-SSE progress
- rewrote some of the SSE functions to use einsum and more idiomatic python
- decided that sse init() should store the psf ffts for use in later computation

** outline of SSE algorithm

   - init
     - calculate PSF ffts
     - calculate $\Gamma$ matrix and $\Lambda = \mathcal{F} \text{1st col of} D_x^T D_x + D_y^T D_y$
   - cost
     - update $\Gamma$ matrix by subtracting removed PSF
     - calculate trace to find cost

* 2018-05-16 - CSBS-SSE completion
- fixed block_inv to work with even sized inputs
- added iteration_end function to cost_module
- derived $Dx^T \cdot Dx + Dy^T \cdot Dy$
